## 📈 Development Process

### 🧠 Planning
- Defined multi-page navigation and user flow
- Outlined key components: onboarding, authentication, dashboard
- Designed reusable SASS partials for styling consistency

### 🛠 Implementation
- Developed static pages with semantic HTML5 and Bootstrap
- Created modular SASS files for:
  - Variables and mixins
  - Components and layout
  - Theme switching
- Wrote JavaScript modules for:
  - Theme toggling
  - Slide navigation and progress updates
  - Authentication form logic
- Enabled persistent storage of user data using:
  - `localStorage` for preferences
  - Conditional DOM rendering based on session

### ✅ Testing
- Cross-browser and cross-device UI testing
- Manual testing of form validation and navigation
- Verified state persistence between page reloads
